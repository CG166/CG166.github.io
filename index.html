      <h1>Meet Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Cindy Garcia, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and aspire to pursue a career as a software engineer.I am currently based in Los Angeles, where I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute to tech that makes a difference.</p>

    <h2>Projects Portfolio</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the projects that I have worked on throughout my time as a Computer Science Student at CSUF. The programming languages used in these projects are mainly C, C++, Python, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, SQL,and PHP, with some MySQL database work.</p>

        <p>This project allows users to compare two PDF documents and estimate the likelihood of plagiarism based on textual similarity. Developed with Python and a Tkinter-based GUI, the tool uses the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) string-matching algorithm to detect repeated patterns between a “master” and a “pattern” file. It parses text content from PDFs using the fitz library (PyMuPDF) and calculates a match percentage based on word-pair analysis. The application provides a clean user-friendly interface for file uploads and returns clear assessment messages.</p>

        <p>This project aimed to create a smart navigation system for a university campus map, allowing users to find different paths between different locations based on factors such as route length and accessibility, using the graph search algorithms Breadth-First search, Depth-First search and Dijkstra's algorithm. The project was built using python with a Tkinter-based GUI.</p>

        <p>This project enables users to upload a PDF document and search for specific phrases within its text content. Built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library, the tool extracts text from PDF files via the fitz (PyMuPDF) module and implements the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm to efficiently locate all instances of the user-defined phrase. The application provides clear feedback on how many times and where the phrase appears in the document.

        <p>The objective of this project was to build a GUI that allowed users to view the visualization of five sorting algorithms( Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort, and Linear Search) with a set of positive non-zero integers that they input. The visualizations will help users to understand how these algorithms sort through data as well as the time complexity differences between them, and how the algorithms respond to different number sets.The project was built using python with a Tkinter-based GUI.</p>
