      <h1>Meet Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Cindy Garcia, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at California State University, Fullerton. I have a strong interest in cybersecurity and aspire to pursue a career as a software engineer.I am currently based in Los Angeles, where I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute to tech that makes a difference.</p>

        <p>This project allows users to compare two PDF documents and estimate the likelihood of plagiarism based on textual similarity. Developed with Python and a Tkinter-based GUI, the tool uses the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) string-matching algorithm to detect repeated patterns between a “master” and a “pattern” file. It parses text content from PDFs using the fitz library (PyMuPDF) and calculates a match percentage based on word-pair analysis. The application provides a clean user-friendly interface for file uploads and returns clear assessment messages.</p>

        <p>This project aimed to create a smart navigation system for a university campus map, allowing users to find different paths between different locations based on factors such as route length and accessibility, using the graph search algorithms Breadth-First search, Depth-First search and Dijkstra's algorithm. The project was built using python with a Tkinter-based GUI.</p>

        <p>This project enables users to upload a PDF document and search for specific phrases within its text content. Built using Python and the Tkinter GUI library, the tool extracts text from PDF files via the fitz (PyMuPDF) module and implements the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm to efficiently locate all instances of the user-defined phrase. The application provides clear feedback on how many times and where the phrase appears in the document.

        <p>The objective of this project was to build a GUI that allowed users to view the visualization of five sorting algorithms( Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Radix Sort, and Linear Search) with a set of positive non-zero integers that they input. The visualizations will help users to understand how these algorithms sort through data as well as the time complexity differences between them, and how the algorithms respond to different number sets.The project was built using python with a Tkinter-based GUI.</p>

        <p>This project was created in collaboration with Gabriella Amedu (<a href="https://github.com/Gabbyamedu">Gabbyamedu</a>) and Anthony Vasquez (<a href="https://github.com/dskoman">dskoman</a>). It is a website made for posting and sharing poems where users can either stay as guest users or they can register and create an account. Guest users are able to navigate through posted poems and read them, leave likes on posted poems and sign up to become registered user; while registered users are able to do everything a guest user can, post their own poems (and delete their own posts), tag their posted poems as belonging to a certain genre/categories, and are able to leave comments on other posted poems.The frontend of the website was developed using HTML and CSS, while the backend was implemented using PHP and SQL, with data stored in a MySQL database.</p>

        <p>This project was created in collaboration with Brian Alvarez (<a href="https://github.com/briandalvarez">briandalvarez</a>) and Jake Mendez (<a href="https://github.com/j1836jake">j1836jake</a>). This project was also built off on an existing open-source Python project from GitHub called anuzis/mancala (<a href="https://github.com/anuzis/mancala">mancala</a>), which has basic Mancala game classes, gameplay that displayed via text in the terminal, a vector-based AI player that optimizes for free turns & captures, and a simple random AI player. This project builds off of that implementation by reworking the existing classes into function with a GUI built using Pygame, and implementing an additional AI player that utilizes MiniMax decision-making.</p>
