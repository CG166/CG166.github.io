### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

Lab 5, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it showed me the mechanics of user input. It got me thinking of the potential an activity like this holds when it comes to building simple applications. It was a bit difficult getting a good handle on using command arguments, but it really helped me explore the bounds of user-program interaction.


* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a fun process of trial and error to try to get it to work. It was really interesting and frustrating at the same time, trying to get the loops to count down properly and in tandem. It was also really helpful to be able to visualize exactly how the loops functioned.


* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite of mine because it was really engaging to take the rules and logistics of a real life game, and then try to create that game using the programming skills we’d learned. It was a tricky, but rewarding process getting the card values to match with the appropriate user inputs. Getting the Ace card value to change depending on the condition of the player’s score was also a very interesting and enjoyable hurdle.
