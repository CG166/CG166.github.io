# Portfolio

Hello, this is my home page! My name is Cindy Garcia and I am an undegraduate student of Computer Science at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/).

## Computer Science Projects

This is a portfolio containing a couple of programming assignments I have completed for some of my Computer Science classes at Cal State Fullerton. My GitHub page is at http://github.com/CG166.

### CPSC 120

** A Project in Creating Simple Animations **

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite of mine because it was a fun process of trial and error to try to get it to work. It was really interesting and frustrating at the same time, trying to get the loops to count down properly and in tandem. It was also really helpful to be able to visualize exactly how the loops functioned.


* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite of mine because it was really engaging to take the rules and logistics of a real life game, and then try to create that game using the programming skills we’d learned. It was a tricky, but rewarding process getting the card values to match with the appropriate user inputs, as well as learning how to properly check the validity of user input. Getting the Ace card value to change depending on the condition of the player’s score was also a very interesting and enjoyable hurdle.
